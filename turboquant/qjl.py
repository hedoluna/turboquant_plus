"""QJL: Quantized Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform.

1-bit quantization via random orthogonal projection → sign to compress
vectors while preserving inner products. Stores a full d×d projection
matrix (O(d²) memory); for large d a structured/seeded approach would be
needed.

Key properties (orthogonal S):
    Q_qjl(x) = sign(S · x), S orthogonal
    Q_qjl_inv(z) = √(π/2) / √d · ||x|| · S^T · z
    E[⟨x̂, y⟩] = ⟨x, y⟩  (unbiased, paper Theorem 2)
    E[||x̂||²] = (π/2) · ||x||²

                with orthogonal S and the √d scale, E[||x̂||²] = (π/2)·||x||²

                α* = 2/π. Shrinking by α* gives a biased but lower-MSE
                estimator that is preferable for downstream MSE-sensitive
                consumers (e.g. attention-score correction).
